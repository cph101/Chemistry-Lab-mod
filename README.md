GitHub repo for my in-progress mod
> [!NOTE]
> This mod is only for quilt. I will eventually make a forge port, however fabric is not possible due to the licensing of a library I am using. Porting to fabric would mean that flames and such would look quite different. *(99% of fabric mods work on quilt)*
